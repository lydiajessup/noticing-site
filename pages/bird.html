  <h1> Bird </h1>

  <p>
    While I was observing the East garden, I scared away a couple birds that were sitting under a bush. Once I moved to the side a bit one of them returned and a second one joined it. They seemed to be eating, picking up little pieces of something. Just as quickly as they came, they left again.
