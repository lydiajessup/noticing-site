  <p>
    On my visits I was very aware of the sounds around me as I observed the garden. I have also noticed that these change depending on the time of day and day of the week that I visit. When I first chose this, but I find notw that there is quite a lot of activity on teh  treet. So on one visit, I spent time listening closely to these sounds. Below is what I heard:
  </p>

  <ul>

    <li>Caw of crow</li>

    <li>Birds chirping</li>

    <li>Car idling</li>

    <li>Cars on busy street</li>

    <li>Music from car</li>

    <li>Laughing on phone</li>

    <li>Music from cafe</li>

    <li>Trucks on street</li>

    <li>Whistling</li>

    <li>Hammer</li>

    <li>Bike passing by</li>

    <li>Wind rustling leaves</li>

    <li>Car diving by</li>

    <li>Kids in stroller</li>

    <li>Man with cane</li>

    <li>Man walking with music</li>

  </ul>
